In case you agreed with your project's Project Exectuing Agency and / or Implementation or Monitoring Consultant to collect the location data of your project/portfolio, you may complete and amend the **Sample Geodata ToR** for project location data collection (which is part of this repository).

If KfW did not yet sign the project's financing or consultant agreement, you may use the option location data collection in the *Table of Contents "Project Location Data Collection & Reporting"* in the **â€œKfW Reporting Requirements"** (available in EN, FR, ES & PT) and which refers to the above ToR, Guidelines and Templates in this repository. 

If KfW already signed the agreement(s), you may agree with them separately on them collecting the project location data by using the above ToR (which include the Guidelines and Templates in this repository).

In case you are interested in a training / Q&A session with a sufficient number of KfW partners and consultants (ideally for an entire country portfolio), or other more complex geodata-related requests, KfW staff may contact the Geodata-Desk.
