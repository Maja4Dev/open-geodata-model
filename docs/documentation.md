> KfW's Project Location Data Collection and Management Approach

## Annex 3.1

> The KfW Geodata Model
>
> In this Section we explain the FC Geodata Model according to which
> project location data should be collected as well as technical
> requirements for the data--collection. The goal is to inform KfW
> staff, PEA, consultants and other external stakeholders responsi- ble
> for data collection as to the types of location data to be collected
> and in what form.
>
> Our FC Geodata Model is based on the IATI standard. The IATI--Standard
> is used by international development organizations and allows
> harmonization of FC project loca- tion data across heterogenous
> projects. The data to be collected are subject to mini- mum
> requirements in the form of mandatory fields, and there are optional
> fields flexibly usable for collecting site-specific information.
>
> Furthermore, projects are able to store single location points (e.g.
> the location of one power plant site) or a larger number of project
> sites and features (e.g. 300 locations of buildings in different
> sectors within the framework of a decentralization project). In
> addition, project sites with larger areas and more complex geometries
> (e.g. polygons of forest protection areas) are supported as well.
>
> Please note that KfW does not publish any exact coordinates of its
> project locations. Location data collection in fragile and conflict
> contexts should be treated with extra dil- igence.

#### 3.1.1 General Notes on Geodata and Location Information

##### What is a project location?

> **A project location can consist of one or more features that are part
> of a finan- cially supported activity where no further geographical
> discrimination regard- ing funding is possible.** An example of a
> single-feature project location is a financially supported hospital in
> a specific location. An example of a project location with multiple
> features is a group of adjacent agricultural plots under a financed
> irrigation plan that benefits all producers in that area. Another
> example is a set of protected areas jointly financed from a fund if
> and only if further geographical discrimination as to the alloca- tion
> of funds to specific areas is not possible. If discrimination is
> possible, data for mul- tiple project locations (such as protected
> areas) and their financial allocation have to be collected. KfW highly
> encourages increasing geographical discrimination of financial flows
> to specific project locations to the maximum possible, as this affords
> greater aid transparency and financial accountability.

##### Difference between exact 34 and approximate locations

> For each project location there will be one exact or approximate
> geolocation data set. The exact geolocation designates the
> geographical end point of an international devel- opment assistance
> financial flow. Approximate locations can be used however when no
> exact geoinformation is (yet) available, or such is not be collected
> for other reasons (details see below).
>
> For exact locations, geographical data are to be collected with GPS
> tools and eventually edited in a Geographical Information System
> (GIS). Approximate locations should be given on administrative scales
> using the GADM database as a global standard.
>
> 34 in the sense of the IATI- Standard

##### When to collect project location information

> KfW strongly encourages the PEA and/or consultant staff to collect
> exact or approxi- mate geo-coordinates as early on as possible in the
> project cycle to increase the usage potential of such data throughout
> the entire project cycle. Ideally, data should be col-
>
> lected already during the project preparation phase, e.g.as part of
> the *Feasibility Study*.
>
> If no exact locations can be determined at this stage, approximate
> location should be used and later be checked during the project
> appraisal and inception stages (including possible transformation from
> approximate to exact location information). During pro- ject
> implementation, data should be updated at least annually in project
> progress reviews, and in order to reflect potential changes in the
> geographical allocation of funds, which are common in Financial
> Cooperation projects.

##### Geometrical characteristics of exact 35 geo location information

> \"Exact locations\" are measured via GPS devices, and geo-coordinates
> are to be col- lected as precisely as possible. For this purpose,
> three different geometry types can be used

1.  Point geometries (e.g. a well or a hospital)

2.  Line geometries (e.g. a road or transmission line)

3.  Polygon geometries/shapes (e.g. a protected area or agricultural
    plots)

> All exact project locations have to be collected at first as a point
> geometry that repre- sents a gateway to the project location,
> irrespective of the actual feature geometry (i.e., also for lines and
> polygons). This may be for example the center of a road, a village
> adjacent to agricultural plots or the administration building of a
> protected forest. If there is a line or polygon geometry and no
> gateway can be defined, the geometrical center (centroid) is to be
> used. This information is to be collected in an Excel--template (xlsx)
> or a future open-source based geodata collection tool providing the
> geographical coordinates of the gateway point (more information to be
> provided at \>

> [talisierung/RMMV-Guidebook/.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publikationen-Videos/Publikationen-thematisch/Digitalisierung/RMMV-Guidebook/)
> In addition, line and polygon geometries have to be col- lected in
> KML36 format independently for each project site (details are given
> below in data formats and templates).

##### When to use approximate 37 geo location information

> Approximate locations can be used when no exact geoinformation is
> available (yet), or when exact location information should not be
> collected and stored. The approximate location option should be chosen
> if one or more of the following circumstances apply:

-   an exact project location has not (yet) been specified

-   an exact project location is not (yet) known or defined

-   the target location(s) is/are one or more administrative units.

> In such cases, approximate location must be defined based on
> administrative units applying the GADM standard \>
> <https://gadm.org/>. GADM is used as a common standard for
> administrative units to afford harmonized and consistent collection of
> approximate locations.

#### A3.1.2 Project Geodata Standard Formats and Templates

##### Exact locations using Excel Template (and potentially KML files)

> As outlined above, all project locations should be collected using the
> Excel template (or a future open-source-based geodata collection tool)
> provided by KfW, which utilizes pre- defined categories under the IATI
> standard and built-in selection methods facilitating clean data entry.
> The geolocation is to be submitted in Excel with the geo-coordinates
>
> that can be obtained with a GPS tool. **All coordinates are to be
> collected using**
>
> **WGS 84** 38 **as the coordinate reference system.** WGS 84 is the
> de--facto standard for web mapping applications. Geo-coordinates are
> to be provided in the decimal place format 00.00000 in the order LONG,
> LAT (using at least 5 digits after the separator).

-   **For point locations** like buildings, filling out the exact GPS
    point location in the

> Excel template is sufficient. We estimate that about 90% of all
> project locations are point locations.

-   **For line and polygon geometries,** the gateway GPS point location
    is stored in

> Excel. In suh this case, geometry data should be supplied additionally
> in KML39 for- mat separately for each project location. For multiple
> line or polygon locations, multi- ple KML files have to be submitted.
> A single KML file can however contain a single geometry (e.g. a road)
> or multiple geometries (e.g. multiple agricultural plots) that are
> linked to the gateway location collected in Excel. Multiple KML files
> should be submitted to KfW as.zip or .tar container. The data
> collector must ensure that the KfW staff responsible for uploading the
> data into the GeoApp are able to connect single KML files with project
> locations to the gateway points in Excel. To do so, the data
> collectors need to use the unique identifier given in the Excel
> template (column "Unique ID") together with the respective location
> name, separated by an underscore character "\_" as filename for the
> KML data. An example of such a KML filename is
> "00345_Ouagadougou.kml". We follow this two-step approach for line and
> polygon geodata to ensure that all relevant metadata is collected in a
> clean way in Excel while still being able to submit relevant geometry
> information in a common geo-- standard. It is strongly encouraged to
> submit additional geometry information in KML for locations larger
> than 1000 m (line) or 500 m2 (shapes) wherever possible to enable KfW
> to see the spatial delimitation of our projects (e.g. a transmission
> line or
>
> the boundaries of a protected area). **KML files are also to be
> submitted using**
>
> **WGS 84 as the coordinate reference system.** The WG S84 datum is
> also used by OpenStreetMaps and Google Maps
> [(http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326](http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326)
> KML Template file). The complete specification for OGC KML can be
> found at [http://](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml/)
> [www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml/](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml/)
> or <https://www.ogc.org/standards/kml>.
>
> It is strongly encouraged to check the data before submission in GIS
> software, such as QGIS or Google Earth Pro. This reduces the need to
> go back and forth between the responsible project managers and the
> projects.

##### Approximate locations using Excel Template and GADM standard

> Approximate project locations should be collected by referencing the
> respective adminis- trative unit on the lowest administrative scale
> available in the GADM standard. GADM differentiates up to seven
> different levels, although for many developing countries, only three
> or four levels have yet been defined. Here are the most commonly
> available admin- istrative unit levels:

-   level 0 (shape of the national boundary)

-   level 1 (region, province, governorate, etc.)

-   level 2 (district, zone, department, municipality etc.)

-   level 3 (community, tehsil, etc.)

> If the respective administrative unit level has not been defined in
> GADM, you may instead indicate the GPS coordinates of the respective
> administrative unit center (munic- ipality, district center or similar
> as a point location). In such case, you must specify the location as
> "approximate" in column No. 21. of the Excel template "Geographic
> Exactness according to IATI standard". This ensures that this location
> is not confused with the actual location of the site.
>
> Mixing the administrative unit levels is not allowed because this
> would render the Geo- data Model inconsistent.
>
> The GIS database of GADM can be downloaded at \>
> <https://gadm.org/data.html> and ana- lyzed in a common Geographic
> Information System such as QGIS, ArcGIS, or Google Earth Pro. Data
> collectors have to enter the GADM-defined polygon Geographic ID (GID),
> the GID level and the utilized GADM database version. See [\> Figure
> A3.2
> below](#approximate-locations-using-excel-template-and-gadm-standard)

##### ![](media/image47.png)How to compare project location data from existing systems (R/MIS, GIS)?

> If a Geographic Information System (GIS), (Remote) Management
> Information System (R/MIS) or Maintenance Management System (MMS) is
> used in the project, then the existing location IDs can also be
> entered in the Excel template as Project-Specific Loca- tion
> Identifiers (No. 7 in the table below), as defined in the Excel
> template. This makes it easier to check location data across project
> partner systems and verify use of funds.

#### A3.1.3 The KfW Project Location Geodata Model for Financial Cooperation

> Below, the required project location data is defined for all FC
> projects. Project-related data is usually provided from both internal
> and external sources. The external data (see column "Source" with
> field entry "Input") has to be provided by the PEA or consultant staff
> using the template(s) provided by KfW and be validated by the
> responsible KfW PM/analyst before uploading.
