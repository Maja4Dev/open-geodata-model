# Overview of existing sample Terms of Reference (ToR) and Templates

Usually, the project's Proejct Excecuting Agency (PEA) and/or Consultant are to collect the location data of their respective project(s) with KfW. For each project, PEA and KfW agree on the amended sample ToR for project location data collection.

These amended ToR form the basis for filling out the Excel-Template by the PEA's or consultant's staff.
